## Dataset
This document explores dataset includes over 6,923,547 records about New York Bike-Sharing Services.
(Because data size of 1 year is too big, so I focus on only three months data from 2020-07 to 2020-09.)

In this dataset there are below information:

## Summary of Findings
In the exploration, I found many intersting information as below:
* People use bike service in summer more than winter.
* Customers use bike service more in weekend. maybe they are tourism and they use for traveling.
* Subcribers use bike service in working days. I think they use bike for commuting to work.
